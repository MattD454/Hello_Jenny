    <h1>Hello Jennifer </h1>
    <p class="intro">The Evolution of my Talent with HTML/CSS</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p> The purpose of this is show the slow evolution of my personal talent
      html and css.As this is a slow process I figured the best way to start
      was to have a living document. This document is written in html and
      made to look amazing with css.
    </p>
    <p> Over the next couple months I will keep updating this on my Github and
      hopefully it will be part of my resume if i decide to start applying
      for web developer positions.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the title</h2>
    <p> Thats a story for another day</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> Currently living in Ottawa, working for Minto as a Commercial Console
        Operator. This position gives me time to work on personal develpment
        as it has me on a computer most of the day.
      </p>
      <p>I gained some interest in web development while serving in the Canadian
        Armed Forces,where I served as Armoured Crewman. Serving gave me the
        dedication I need to make self teaching, whether it be web develpment
        or it be going back to High School to take Math again in order to
        better myself.
      </p>
      <p> My short term goal is get into Carleton University in order to earn
        a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering.
      </p>
